Description:
--------------------------------------
In this example the user enters some text into a field and hits the submit button. If the text is longer
than 3 characters it prints a congrats message, else it prints an error message.

All bots (with the execption of the blind bot) should be able to find all states of this example. There also should
be multiple edges between states since user can use both keyboar commands and click to complete the action.
