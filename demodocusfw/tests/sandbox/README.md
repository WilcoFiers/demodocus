# Demodocus-Sandbox

## Description
This directory contains examples that will be used to showcase/test the capabilities of the crawlers. 

## Directory Structure
The top level folders will be the names of a general example (e.g. `list/`). Each of those sub
folders are named according to the functionality for the crawler to
try. Inside of that sub folder is an `example.html` and typically a `notes.txt`, which contains
human-readable explanation of what to expect from that example.

For instance, a list example that is partially accessibly is found `list/partaccessible_1/example.html`).

## Running the html file
To run the example `html` pages, launch it from your file browser or editor, or use an HTTP-server 
(recommend using python [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)).
